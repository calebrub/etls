I informed her that I wanted to establish a negotiation for a higher pay and requested her to connect me or get me their contact/email address. She stated that they don't communicate to external parties directly and so they don't have a direct contact/email. She went ahead to send them an email letting them know that the provider expected an allowed amount of 72% of the charge amount and so the claim should be repriced under Service ticket#PACB-529985 and advised that we follow up next week for their feedback.

She further stated that the member has a MCR rate type covered at 110%. I informed the Rep that the claim is underpaid as we expected at least 75% OON reimbursement, but she stated that the claims can only be appealed for and can't be sent back for a repricing review. (If we appealed based on 75% expected reimbursement, we shall require member AOR form). Ref# D51041656579584  Based off research, if the patient's Medicare rates are covered at 110%, the expected payment for RTC in the Locality – Rest of California is $688.50. However, the claim allowed and paid at the maximum amount of $806.83, which exceeds the anticipated Medicare payment by $118.33. Thus, the claim paid correctly.

She further stated that the claim has been paid at the Maximum of $2,304.18 and no further adjustments forthcoming. Ref# 99999709 Based off research, this is a Self-funded plan where the patient's Medicare rates are covered at 110%, the expected payment for Detox in the Locality – Rest of California is $1,377.01. However, the claim was paid at the maximum amount of $2,304.18, which exceeds the anticipated Medicare payment.  Called Cigna @ (800) 244-6224 and spoke to LY P, I informed the Rep that the claim underpaid as we expected at least 75% OON reimbursement of the total billed of $6,775.00 which is $5,081.25 much as Data iSight the Pricer is unable to reprice the claim beyond $2,304.18. She stated that the claim can't be sent back for external repricing and can only be disputed through an appeal. Rep stated that an appeal and Member AOR is required for disputing the claim at 75% of the total billed. Will follow up in 7 days.
